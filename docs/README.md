# FTC Team 18650 - The Cookie Clickers Documentation

This directory contains additional team documentation. Files here won't conflict with upstream FTC SDK updates.

## Available Documentation

- Add robot configuration guides here
- Add competition checklists here
- Add troubleshooting guides here
- Add design documents here

## Documentation Pattern

We keep our documentation separate from the FTC SDK files to maintain clean upstream compatibility. Any file we create that doesn't exist in the original FTC SDK can be safely added without merge conflicts.
